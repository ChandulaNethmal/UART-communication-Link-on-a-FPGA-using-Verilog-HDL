# UART-communication-Link-on-a-FPGA-using-Verilog-HDL
This post is regarding a HDL implementation of a UART(Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) for one of our university fourth semester projects.For the project we were supposed to implement a UART link for a FPGA development board using Verilog as the HDL and send some data to another FPGA development board which also have a UART implementation.

Here we used a Used a Digilant Atlys FPGA development board with a Xilinx FPGA. That board is actually expensive to buy. But we burrowed that one from our laboratory for this project. There is no problem if you want to implement this using another board.
