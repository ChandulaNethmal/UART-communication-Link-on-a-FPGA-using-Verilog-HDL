# UART-communication-Link-on-a-FPGA-using-Verilog-HDL
This post is regarding a HDL implementation of a UART(Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) for one of our university fourth semester projects.For the project we were supposed to implement a UART link for a FPGA development board using Verilog as the HDL and send some data to another FPGA development board which also have a UART implementation.
